        <a href="#" name="faq-10">Care and Cleaning</a><br />
        <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-10">
        <ul>
        	<li>Vacuum cleaning is a quick and efficient way to remove loose particles.</li>
        	<li>Stubborn or dried –on particles can be removed by using a soft brush (soft nail brush) then cleaned with a vacuum.</li>
        	<li>A damp cloth, NOT WATER –LADEN, may be used every so often to remove surface residue. The cloth should be of the non-dyed type as dyes can be transferred to the natural fibre.</li>
        	<li>In the event of a major spillage, lightly wipe the affected area with a dry cloth or kitchen towel immediately to remove excess, then allow chair to dry naturally. Never vigorously rub the woven fibre when wet.</li>
        	<li>Occasionally, the legs can be scuffed by footwear, these scuffs can be removed using a damp cloth and soapy water, do not over rub.</li>
        	<li>If the coated woven natural fibre is damaged and exposed, it is recommended that the area be re-coated using the touch-up pot supplied and a small paint brush to re-seal the damaged area.</li>
        	<li>Do not leave or store outside in a damp atmosphere.</li>
        	<li>Do not use cleaning solvents/stain removers or chemicals, as they will harm the natural fibre.</li>
        	<li>Do not soak whilst cleaning </li>
        </ul>
